==========

A project I put together over the summer for a (now-defunct) Instagram-based marketing company. It's a fairly straightforward Cake app with a frontend based off of Bootstrap, both choices made for the sake of rapid development on a constricted timeframe. Plus I wrote most of this from a car driving through the American midwest without internet, so I wanted to stick with technologies which I knew like the back of my hand.

Of interest are two things: the first is an expanded version of https://github.com/nodesagency/cake-instagram-datasource which can pull from Instagram user profiles and not just imagery. The second is in RevenueReport.php, where I put together a system to automatically pull revenue reports for Rakuten LinkShare marketing channels into the local database for reference, something which may be of use to others trying to use their API.
